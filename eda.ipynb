    "   - Visualizations were generated to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Patients Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Missing values were handled, with some columns dropped and others imputed.\n",
    "   - Univariate analysis focused on `GENDER`, `ETHNICITY`, and `DECEASED`.\n",
    "   - Bivariate analysis showed the relationship between `GENDER` and `DECEASED`, as well as `ETHNICITY` and `DECEASED`.\n",

    "   - Handled missing values and cleaned columns like `AGE`, `STAGE_BEST`, and `DIAGNOSISDATEBEST`.\n",
    "   - Univariate analysis explored the distribution of `AGE`, `STAGE_BEST`, and `GRADE`.\n",
    "   - Bivariate analysis explored the relationship between `AGE` and `STAGE_BEST`, and `AGE` and `GRADE`.\n",

    "### 4. **Lookup Tables Dataset**:\n",
    "   - This dataset served as a reference table for codes and descriptions, and while it didnâ€™t require extensive cleaning, it will help interpret the codes in other datasets."

    "### Explanation of Statistical Tests Used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Choice of Statistical Test:**\n",
    "The **t-test** (specifically, an independent two-sample t-test) was chosen to compare the means of survival months between the two cohorts. The t-test is appropriate because:\n",
    "- We are comparing the means of two independent groups (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) to determine if there is a significant difference in survival months between them.\n",
    "- The t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed, and we performed this test under the assumption that the survival data follows a normal distribution for each cohort. We did not explicitly check the normality of the data, which is an important consideration. However, with sufficiently large sample sizes (as we have here), the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the mean can still approximate normality, even if the underlying data is not perfectly normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Test Results Interpretation:**\n",
    "The t-statistic of -1.63 and p-value of 0.1034 suggest:\n",
    "- The difference in survival months between the two cohorts is **not statistically significant** at the 0.05 level. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the treatments in these two cohorts resulted in significantly different survival outcomes.\n",
    "- The choice of a **two-tailed test** was appropriate because we are testing for differences in both directions (whether Cohort 1 might have higher or lower survival months than Cohort 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Assumptions of the t-test:**\n",
    "The t-test assumes:\n",
    "- **Independence**: The data in the two cohorts should be independent of each other.\n",
    "- **Normality**: The survival months within each cohort should follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Equality of Variance**: The variances of survival months in the two cohorts should be equal. If this assumption is violated, a Welch's t-test (which adjusts for unequal variances) would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the p-value of 0.1034 suggests that there is no significant difference in means, but the normality and equality of variances assumptions should be checked rigorously in a more thorough analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Issues and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Negative Survival Months:**\n",
    "- The **negative survival months** (values like -10.47 months and -9.50 months) suggest that there may be **data entry issues** or inconsistencies in how `VITALSTATUSDATE` or `DIAGNOSISDATEBEST` were recorded. This could happen if the diagnosis or death dates were improperly entered (e.g., if dates are swapped or incorrect), leading to biologically implausible survival times.\n",
    "- **Action**: These negative values should be carefully examined and handled. They could either be removed or corrected based on additional data or domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Data Missingness:**\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: The dataset has significant missing values in key columns (e.g., `T_BEST`, `N_BEST`, `M_BEST`, `VITALSTATUSDATE`, etc.). Missing data can introduce **bias**, especially if the missingness is not random. For example:\n",
    "  - If certain treatments are more likely to have missing `VITALSTATUSDATE` (i.e., alive patients have missing death dates), this could bias the survival analysis.\n",
    "  - **Action**: Missing values should be carefully handled using imputation techniques or by excluding rows with incomplete data if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Cohort Selection Bias:**\n",
    "- **Cohort Definition**: The cohorts were defined based on the most common treatment transitions. This selection could lead to **selection bias** if certain treatments are overrepresented in the dataset (e.g., if the data heavily features certain chemotherapy drugs).\n",
    "- **Action**: The methodology could be adjusted to include more balanced or randomized cohort selection to mitigate selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Sample Size and Generalizability:**\n",
    "- The **sample sizes** for both cohorts are large, which generally helps ensure that the statistical tests have adequate power. However, the survival months data could still have variability, and the cohorts might not be fully representative of the general population if specific treatments are overrepresented.\n",
    "- **Action**: A more refined sampling method (stratified sampling) could help ensure that the cohorts are more comparable across various important covariates (e.g., age, stage, grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Survival Time Calculations:**\n",
    "- The survival time calculation method assumes that patients who are still alive have been followed up until the present time. However, **right-censoring** (patients who are still alive at the end of the study period) can lead to **bias** in survival analysis. This should ideally be addressed using **Kaplan-Meier curves** or **Cox Proportional Hazards Models** for more accurate survival comparisons.\n",
    "- **Action**: A survival analysis method that accounts for censoring (such as Kaplan-Meier or Cox models) would be more appropriate to handle right-censoring and provide more robust results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Age and Treatment Heterogeneity:**\n",
    "- The treatments and survival outcomes may vary significantly across different **age groups**, **tumor stages**, or other covariates that were not fully controlled for in the analysis. If these factors are not accounted for, they could introduce confounding bias.\n",
    "- **Action**: Matching or stratification based on these covariates (e.g., age, tumor stage) would help ensure that the comparison between cohorts is fair and more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The **t-test** used in this analysis is appropriate for comparing the means of survival months between two cohorts, but there are some data issues (negative survival months, missing data) that could affect the results.\n",
    "- **Bias** from missing data, cohort selection, and potential confounders should be addressed in future analyses.\n",
    "- A more robust survival analysis, such as Kaplan-Meier or Cox regression, would be more appropriate to account for censoring and other potential biases."
